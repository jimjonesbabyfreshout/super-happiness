## Deployment

Once you have configured your VPN, you can deploy it to GitHub Pages by running the following command:

npm run deploy

npm run build && git subtree push —prefix dist origin gh-pages

```
npm run deploy
```

The `npm run deploy` command is a shortcut for running the following script:

```
npm run build && git subtree push —prefix dist origin gh-pages
```

This script does the following:

1. Runs the `npm run build` command, which builds your project.
2. Runs the `git subtree push` command, which pushes the contents of the `dist` directory to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository.

The `git subtree push` command is a convenient way to deploy a static website to GitHub Pages. It works by creating a new commit on the `gh-pages` branch that contains the contents of the specified directory.

In this case, the `dist` directory contains the built version of your project. By pushing the contents of this directory to the `gh-pages` branch, you are effectively deploying your website to GitHub Pages.

Once you have pushed your changes to the `gh-pages` branch, GitHub Pages will automatically create a static website for your project. This website will be available at the following URL:

```
https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-project-name>
```

You can replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username and `<your-project-name>` with the name of your project.

For example, if your GitHub username is `johndoe` and your project name is `super-happiness`, then your website will be available at the following URL:

```
https://johndoe.github.io/super-happiness
```

* Make sure that your VPN server is running.
